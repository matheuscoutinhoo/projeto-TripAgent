## TripAgent
- This was my first front-end project.
- The project is a home page of a trip agency website, and all the content was made by myself.
- The layout design template that I've used is here: https://webflow.com/templates/html/biznus-retail-website-template
- The project isn't responsive yet, but I will improve it later as my knowledge evolves.

<h3>Used technologies:</h3>
- HTML 5;
- CSS 3;
- SCSS.
